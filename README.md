## 📌 Project Summary

This is a no-code Web3 project that collects, preserves, and showcases artwork created during **Nouns DAO contests, proposals, and events**. Many of these arts are beautiful but get lost over time. We’re building a platform that archives them, turns them into downloadable wallpapers, allows minting as NFTs, and supports interaction via **Farcaster Frames**.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- 🧱 **Framer** – for UI and UX design  
- 🔗 **Netlify** – for hosting  
- 📋 **Airtable** – to manage artist submissions & artwork entries  
- 🧙‍♂️ **Farcaster** – to allow users to view or mint directly in Frames  
- ⚡️ Planning to use **custom scraping tools or APIs** to automate fetching of arts
