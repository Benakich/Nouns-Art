## 📌 What Is This?

**Nouns Art Collector** is a no-code Web3 project that collects and showcases artworks created for **Nouns DAO** events – from contests and proposals to seasonal themes.

These artworks are often forgotten, scattered across the web. We're building a lightweight, beautiful home for them:  
→ As downloadable wallpapers  
→ As creative inspiration  
→ As interactive Farcaster Frames  
→ As future NFT drops

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Nouns has inspired a wave of creative expression.  
But most Noun Art fades away post-event.

This project:
- Preserves culture in one place  
- Opens up discovery (via Frames and tags)  
- Helps artists get recognition  
- Powers future storytelling + design efforts
